# **pledge** ðŸ“œ

*An experimental playground for core components of ZKP*

## Overview

**pledge** is my personal playground experimenting with ZKP. As for now, it includes **polynomial commitment schemes** and **sumcheck**.

This project is intended as a sandbox for trying out ideas, comparing different commitment schemes, and understanding their tradeoffs in terms of efficiency, security, and implementation complexity.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yuxqiu/pledge.git
cd pledge
```

Run tests:

```bash
cargo test
```
